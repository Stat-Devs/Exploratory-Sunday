## Introduction to Exploratory Sunday{.smaller}


-   Exploratory Sunday is a social awareness campaign initiated by StatDevs.

-   Every Sunday, we post weekly statistics and visualizations concentrating on Pakistan's demographic, healthcare and socio-economic indicators.

-   The aim of this compaign is to raise awareness to masses about how Pakistan's conditions stack up against Sustainable Development Goals.

-   These posts are made using Open Source data sets such as PDHS(2017-18), PSLM(2019-20), Pakistan Census (2017) data.

## Call to Action


- Pakistanâ€™s healthcare system relies predominantly on Out-of Pocket financing.

- Spatial disparities in access to basic to health necessities has widened in Pakistan.

- The burden of out-of-pocket expenditure is much greater for poor households than rich ones.

- Ensuring implementation and monitoring the correctness of the laws by health system governance can help reduce OOP payments and can improve Pakistan Health Infrastructure.
