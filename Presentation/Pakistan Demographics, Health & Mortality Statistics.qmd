## Call to Action


- Pakistan’s healthcare system relies predominantly on Out-of Pocket financing.

- Spatial disparities in access to basic to health necessities has widened in Pakistan.

- The burden of out-of-pocket expenditure is much greater for poor households than rich ones.

- Ensuring implementation and monitoring the correctness of the laws by health system governance can help reduce OOP payments and can improve Pakistan Health Infrastructure.
